v1.0.3 (2026-02-25)

* Redesign `git-snapshot` human output for `list` and `show` to provide
  readable snapshot metadata, commit relation context, captured file inventory,
  and restore-readiness diagnostics.

* Add explicit porcelain output mode for `list` and richer porcelain records for
  `show` so scripts can consume stable machine-readable fields.

* Add new inspection commands:
  - `git-snapshot diff <snapshot_id>` to inspect captured staged/unstaged/
    untracked snapshot content
  - `git-snapshot compare <snapshot_id>` to evaluate restore compatibility with
    explicit compatibility exit codes (`0` clean, `3` issues).

* Add new inspection helpers in `lib/git-snapshot/inspect.bash` for commit
  relation classification, file inventory extraction, apply-check probes,
  collision detection, and human-readable time/age formatting.

* Expand `README.md` into full operational documentation with scope/exactness
  model, command semantics, safety controls, troubleshooting guidance, and
  porcelain contract examples.

* Update workflow-skill command contract docs and add test coverage for human
  output, porcelain output, and `diff`/`compare` behaviors.

v1.0.2 (2026-02-25)

* Change snapshot storage layout to write snapshots directly under
  `~/git-snapshots/<root-most-repo-name>/<snapshot_id>` (remove the extra
  `snapshots/` sub-folder).

* Update `git-snapshot` tests and docs to match the new root-level snapshot
  directory structure.

v1.0.1 (2026-02-25)

* Fix `git-snapshot create <snapshot_id>` to preserve the explicit snapshot id
  instead of always generating an auto id.

* Add snapshot id validation for `create`, `show`, `restore`, and `delete`
  (reject empty, path-like, or invalid-character ids).

* Add regression coverage for explicit snapshot ids, duplicate-id rejection,
  and invalid-id rejection.

v1.0.0 (2026-02-25)

* Add `git-snapshot` CLI with root-most repo discovery, scoped safety guard,
  create/show/list/delete flows, and restore verification.

* Add restore safety model with typed confirmation, auto safety snapshot,
  best-effort HEAD-mismatch restore, and automatic rollback on failure.

* Add dependency-free temp-only test suite covering nested submodules,
  PWD-level scope resolution, exact restore parity, head-mismatch behavior,
  rollback behavior, and enforce-prefix protection.

* Add shared `git-snapshot-workflow` skill in `skills/` with reusable command
  contract docs and a generic repo-link helper for consumer symlink onboarding.
