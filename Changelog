v1.0.1 (2026-02-25)

* Fix `git-snapshot create <snapshot_id>` to preserve the explicit snapshot id
  instead of always generating an auto id.

* Add snapshot id validation for `create`, `show`, `restore`, and `delete`
  (reject empty, path-like, or invalid-character ids).

* Add regression coverage for explicit snapshot ids, duplicate-id rejection,
  and invalid-id rejection.

v1.0.0 (2026-02-25)

* Add `git-snapshot` CLI with root-most repo discovery, scoped safety guard,
  create/show/list/delete flows, and restore verification.

* Add restore safety model with typed confirmation, auto safety snapshot,
  best-effort HEAD-mismatch restore, and automatic rollback on failure.

* Add dependency-free temp-only test suite covering nested submodules,
  PWD-level scope resolution, exact restore parity, head-mismatch behavior,
  rollback behavior, and enforce-prefix protection.

* Add shared `git-snapshot-workflow` skill in `skills/` with reusable command
  contract docs and a generic repo-link helper for consumer symlink onboarding.
